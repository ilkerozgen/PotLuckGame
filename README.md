# PotLuckGame
This is a game based on a 5 by 5 matrix of buttons. One of the buttons hides the star, while two of the buttons hide bombs. A status bar at the bottom of the window shows the number of guesses. The player needs to find the star without clicking on the bombs. This game is implemented in Java, as a lab assignment.
